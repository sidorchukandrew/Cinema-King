# Cinema King 
Cinema King is a desktop application that mimics video streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. It does not actually stream movies, however. The purpose of this project was to learn about MySQL databases and how to connect to a server in a Java application. Jsoup was used to scrape the top 100 movies from Rotten Tomatoes to populate the database.
